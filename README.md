# sessions-demo-using-expressjs
This demonstrates how to use sessions in ExpressJS to store and retrieve information between requests. <br/>
Sessions are useful for keeping track of user authentication, user preferences, and other information that needs to be persisted across multiple requests.
The express-session middleware provides a simple way to manage sessions in ExpressJS. It uses a secure cookie to store a unique session ID on the client side, and it stores the session data on the server side.
